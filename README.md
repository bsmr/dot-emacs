# .emacs

My `.emacs` configuration. Actually `.emacs` is wrong, because everything is in `.emacs.d` directory now, starting with `.emacs.d\init.el`.

## Abstract

This is about my Emacs configuration. It is a fresh start, because I use something like [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) now.

The goals of my setup are to extend Emacs in the following ways:

* TeX/LaTeX support (using TexLive)
* Erlang/OTP support, with `erlang-mode` from the Erlang source tree
* Elixir support
* SBCL support
* VI support
